# Identify_Customer_Segments
In this project, Bertelsmann partners AZ Direct and Arvato Financial Solutions have provided two datasets one with demographic information about the people of Germany, and one with that same information for customers of a mail-order sales company. Youâ€™ll look at relationships between demographics features, organize the population into clusters, and see how prevalent customers are in each of the segments obtained.

It is highly recommended that you use the Anaconda distribution to install Python, since the distribution includes all necessary Python libraries as well as Jupyter Notebooks. The following libraries are expected to be used in this project:

NumPy
pandas
Sklearn / scikit-learn
Matplotlib (for data visualization)
Seaborn (for data visualization)

# Step 1: Preprocessing

# Step 2: Feature Transformation

# Step 3: Clustering
